## Developer
- **Name**: ozan
- **GitHub**: @TorikBh
- **Discord**: ozanmaning
- **Experience**: Web3 developer with focus on decentralized infrastructure, monitoring, and analytics tools. Experienced in building Node.js backends, React frontends, and blockchain integrations.

## Project

### Name & Category
- **Project**: ChainPulse
- **Category**: infrastructure

### Description
ChainPulse is an analytics and monitoring platform for decentralized applications and smart contracts. It solves the problem of limited visibility into on-chain activity, node health, and transaction reliability.  
With ChainPulse, developers and operators can track performance, detect anomalies, and receive alerts in real-time, making it easier to maintain secure and efficient Web3 services.

### SL Integration
ChainPulse will use Soundness Layer (SL) for:  
- **Secure Logging**: Storing transaction logs and monitoring data with verifiable integrity.  
- **Decentralized Data Anchoring**: Ensuring analytics cannot be tampered with.  
- **Alert Reliability**: SL-backed guarantees that alerts reflect true on-chain events.

## Technical

### Architecture
- **Data Layer**: Blockchain event listeners subscribe to smart contracts and nodes.  
- **Processing Layer**: Node.js backend aggregates, filters, and stores data.  
- **Storage Layer**: PostgreSQL for structured data, Redis for caching, SL for secure logs.  
- **UI Layer**: React dashboard visualizing metrics, alerts, and reports.  
- **Integration Layer**: Discord/Slack bots for real-time notifications.

### Stack
- **Frontend**: React + TailwindCSS  
- **Backend**: Node.js (Express)  
- **Blockchain**: SL + Ethereum-compatible chains  
- **Storage**: PostgreSQL, Redis, SL, optional IPFS for reports  

### Features
1. Real-time transaction analytics (throughput, gas usage, failure rates)  
2. Smart contract monitoring with event subscriptions and alerts  
3. Node and infrastructure health tracking (latency, uptime, performance)  
4. Customizable dashboard with charts and anomaly detection  
5. Integration with Discord/Slack for developer notifications  

## Timeline

### PoC (2-4 weeks)
- [ ] Implement blockchain event listener & logging  
- [ ] Basic integration with SL for secure data storage  
- [ ] Simple dashboard showing real-time metrics  

### MVP (4-8 weeks)
- [ ] Add anomaly detection and advanced analytics  
- [ ] Implement full monitoring dashboard with charts and alerts  
- [ ] Production deployment on VPS/cloud with user testing  

## Innovation
Most monitoring tools are centralized or built for enterprise use. ChainPulse focuses on **open-source, developer-friendly, and decentralized-first monitoring**. By anchoring logs and metrics into the Soundness Layer, it ensures transparency, verifiability, and trust — features that traditional monitoring tools lack.
