## Overview
ChainPulse is a monitoring and analytics tool designed to provide real-time visibility into decentralized applications and smart contracts. It helps developers and operators track performance, detect anomalies, and ensure reliability of Web3 services.

## Problem Statement
Developers and teams often lack accessible tools to monitor blockchain events, transaction throughput, error rates, and user interactions in real-time. Existing solutions are either too complex, centralized, or expensive. This makes it difficult for small teams to maintain performance and security of their decentralized apps.

## Proposed Solution
ChainPulse will provide:
- **Transaction Analytics**: Track on-chain activity, transaction volume, gas usage, and failure rates.  
- **Smart Contract Monitoring**: Real-time event logging with customizable alerts (Slack/Discord integration).  
- **Infrastructure Health**: Node performance, latency, and uptime monitoring.  
- **Developer Dashboard**: Visual reports with charts, metrics, and anomaly detection.  

The tool will integrate with SL for secure logging and decentralized data integrity.

## Technical Architecture
- **Frontend**: React + Tailwind (dashboard UI).  
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express for API services.  
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for structured data, Redis for caching.  
- **Blockchain Integration**: Web3.js / ethers.js for event subscriptions.  
- **SL Integration**: Store logs/metrics with SL for verifiable analytics.  
- **Deployment**: Dockerized microservices, deployable on cloud or VPS.  

## Development Timeline
**Week 1-2**:  
- Set up project structure, GitHub repo, and CI/CD pipeline.  
- Implement blockchain event listener & basic API endpoints.  

**Week 3-4**:  
- Build frontend dashboard with charts and metrics.  
- Add smart contract monitoring & alert system.  

**Week 5-6**:  
- Integrate SL for secure log storage.  
- Implement anomaly detection and reporting.  

**Week 7**:  
- Internal testing and bug fixes.  
- Deploy on testnet environment.  

**Week 8**:  
- Public beta release with community feedback loop.  

## Team
Solo developer (initial stage). Open to collaboration with contributors from the community.

## Expected Outcome
A developer-friendly, open-source monitoring platform that improves transparency, reliability, and performance for decentralized apps.
